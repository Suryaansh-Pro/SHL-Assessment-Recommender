## SHL Assessment Recommendation System - Technical Summary

### 1. Data Collection Methodology
- Direct integration with SHL product catalog
- Structured data extraction for key fields:
  - Assessment name and URL
  - Duration and support features
  - Test types and descriptions
- Data validation ensures completeness and accuracy
- Regular updates maintain catalog freshness

### 2. System Architecture
```
[User Query] → [Query Processor]
                     ↓
[Constraint Parser] → [Semantic Search] → [Ranking Engine]
                     ↓
[Results Formatter] → [Response]

Components:
- Query Processor: Extracts key requirements
- Constraint Parser: Identifies duration limits
- Semantic Search: Matches skills and requirements
- Ranking Engine: Scores and sorts results
```
